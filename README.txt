Questions

-How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
  
  Aside from using React and plain JS, I utilized technologies that I was familiar with. I implemented the app using redux because some areas of the application shared state and I thought it would be more organized. I used a styling framework called bootstrap for basic responsiveness and UX/UI design.


-Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
 
 I could have made improvements on the responsiveness and by fixing the "Save comment" feature.


-What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

  I would have researched the json-server API inorder to complete the "Save comment" feature and try to find any areas that needed optimization/refactoring.
